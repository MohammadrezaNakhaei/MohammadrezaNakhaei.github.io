I'm a first year PhD student at [Robot Learning Lab](https://rl.aalto.fi/) at Aalto University under supervision of [Dr. Joni Pajarinen](https://people.aalto.fi/joni.pajarinen). Currently, my research is focused on reinforcement learning and robotics. To be more specific, I'm investigating planning in offline goal-conditioned RL. Also I am involved in an industrial project where we are using spot robot to autonomously colllect data on construction site. 

I got my master degree in mechatronics engineering at University of Tehran. I was supervised by Dr. Askari Moghadam and my research was about supervised methods in reinforcement learning. I investigated methods to imrpove the stablity and performance of reward-conditioned methods by considering sequential models (GRU, LSTM, Clockwork RNN, and Transformers) in the behavior function and intrinsic reward to encourage more efficient exploration. 

I got my bachelor degree in mechanical engineering at Iran University of Science and Technology. I was a member of robotic research lab supervised by Prof. Habibnejad Korayem where I had the chance to learn about industrial manipulators (particularly Hyundai HS group), different control methods (optimal, robust and adaptive), robotics, and basic electronics.

## Industrial projects

**Automatic path planning of spraying robot**

  - *2020 - 2021*
  -  SQ 15_06N manipulator for spraying different bodies in the factory
  -  Program capable of generating and simulating default paths in the robot such as linear, circular, zigzag and automatic path generation. 
  - Matlab GUI was first tried, which was slow and hard to maintain. [RoboDK](https://robodk.com/) was used instead.
