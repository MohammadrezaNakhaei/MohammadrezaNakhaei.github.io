<style>body {text-align: justify}</style>

I am a third-year PhD student at the [Robot Learning Lab](https://rl.aalto.fi/) at Aalto University, supervised by [Dr. Joni Pajarinen](https://people.aalto.fi/joni.pajarinen).  
My current research focuses on reinforcement learning and robotics, with a particular emphasis on **offline meta-RL**. In this setting, the goal is to train generalizable policies by leveraging datasets from multiple tasks. I am also interested in **representation learning**, such as developing efficient latent world models and studying disentanglement.

I earned my Master‚Äôs degree in Mechatronics Engineering from the University of Tehran, under the supervision of Dr. Askari Moghadam. My research explored supervised methods in reinforcement learning, focusing on improving the stability and performance of reward-conditioned methods. I investigated the use of sequential models (GRU, LSTM, Clockwork RNN, and Transformers) in the behavior function, along with intrinsic rewards to encourage more efficient exploration.

I obtained my Bachelor‚Äôs degree in Mechanical Engineering from the Iran University of Science and Technology. As a member of the Robotics Research Lab, supervised by Prof. Habibnejad Korayem, I gained hands-on experience with industrial manipulators (particularly the Hyundai HS series), various control methods (optimal, robust, and adaptive), robotics, and basic electronics.

# üë®‚Äçüíª Projects

## Industrial projects

**Automatic path planning of spraying robot**

  - *2020 - 2021*
  -  SQ 15_06N manipulator for spraying different bodies in the factory
  -  Program capable of generating and simulating default paths in the robot such as linear, circular, zigzag and automatic path generation. 
  - Matlab GUI was first tried, which was slow and hard to maintain. [RoboDK](https://robodk.com/) was used instead.
